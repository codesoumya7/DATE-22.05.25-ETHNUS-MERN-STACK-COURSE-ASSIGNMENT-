  <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

  <p>
    <i>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</i> is used to create documents on the <u>World Wide Web</u>. It is simply a collection of certain key words called <b>"Tags"</b> that are helpful in writing the document to be displayed using a browser on the Internet. HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1992.
